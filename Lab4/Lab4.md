## **2. Target Architecture Description**
The application will be migrated to a cloud-based infrastructure with a multi-region setup. The architecture is designed for high availability and fault tolerance across two regions (Region A and Region B). Key components include:

- **WebServerVMs:** Host static **frontend** content and are replicated across both regions.
- **SQLVMs:** Host the **backend** SQL database and are replicated with automatic failover.
- **Regional Load Balancers (LB-A and LB-B):** Distribute traffic within each region to the WebServerVMs.
- **DNS Traffic Manager (DTM):** Routes user traffic to the optimal region based on policies such as geographic location, latency, or failover. It acts as the first point of contact for user requests.
- **Global Load Balancer (GLB):** Distributes traffic within the selected region to the Regional Load Balancers.
- **Database Replication:** Synchronous replication ensures data consistency across regions.
- **Failover Mechanism:** Automatic failover is triggered if a region becomes unavailable, ensuring minimal downtime.

## **3. Migration Steps**

### **Step 1: Replicate Virtual Machines Across Regions**
- Use a cloud migration tool (e.g., Azure Migrate) to replicate WebServerVM and SQLVM from the source environment to both Region A and Region B.
- Ensure the replicated VMs are configured identically to the source VMs.

### **Step 2: Configure Load Balancers**
- Deploy a **Global Load Balancer (GLB)** to route traffic to the healthiest region based on latency and availability.
- Deploy **Regional Load Balancers (LB-A and LB-B)** in each region to distribute traffic evenly across WebServerVMs.
- Configure health checks for WebServerVMs to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

### **Step 3: Implement Database Replication and Failover**
- Set up **synchronous database replication** between SQLVMs in Region A and Region B using a managed database service (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS Multi-Region).
- Configure **automatic failover** to ensure that if one region goes down, the database in the other region becomes the primary instance.
- Test the failover mechanism to ensure it meets the 6-hour downtime requirement.

### **Step 4: Configure DNS Traffic Manager**
- Deploy a **DNS Traffic Manager (DTM)** to manage global traffic routing.
- Configure the DTM with **failover routing** to direct traffic to the secondary region if the primary region becomes unavailable.
- Optionally, configure **geographic routing** to direct users to the nearest region based on their location.
- Test the DTM configuration to ensure it responds correctly to regional failures.

### **How is downtime minimized during migration?**
To ensure the application can handle no more than 6 hours of downtime, we implemented:

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Redundant deployment across two regions for failover.
- **DNS Traffic Manager (DTM)**: Automatically redirects traffic to the secondary region during failures.
- **Global Load Balancer (GLB)**: Distributes traffic and performs health checks to route traffic to healthy instances.
- **Database Replication & Failover**: Synchronous replication and automatic failover for the database.
- **Redundant WebServerVMs**: Frontend servers replicated across regions for high availability.
- **Testing & Validation**: Failover and performance testing to ensure system resilience.
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Real-time monitoring and alerts for quick issue resolution.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Regular drills and a plan to restore services within 6 hours.

## **Role of DNS Traffic Manager**
The **DNS Traffic Manager (DTM)** plays a critical role in the architecture by:
- Providing **global traffic routing** based on policies such as failover, geographic location, or latency.
- Ensuring **high availability** by automatically redirecting traffic to the secondary region if the primary region fails.
- Improving **user experience** by directing users to the nearest region, reducing latency.

By integrating DNS Traffic Manager, the architecture becomes more robust and user-friendly, ensuring seamless failover and optimal performance for global users.
